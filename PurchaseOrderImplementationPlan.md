# Purchase Order Implementation Plan

## 1. Backend (CompanyManagementSystem):

*   **Create a PurchaseOrder model:** This model will represent a purchase order and will include properties such as `Id`, `CompanyId`, `OrderDate`, `TotalAmount`, and `LineItems`.
*   **Create a LineItem model:** This model will represent a line item in a purchase order and will include properties such as `Id`, `PurchaseOrderId`, `ProductId`, `Quantity`, and `UnitPrice`.
*   **Update the ApplicationDbContext:** Add `DbSet` properties for `PurchaseOrders` and `LineItems` to the `ApplicationDbContext`.
*   **Create a PurchaseOrderController:** This controller will handle the creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of purchase orders. It will include endpoints for:
    *   `POST /api/purchaseorders`: Create a new purchase order.
    *   `GET /api/purchaseorders`: Get all purchase orders.
    *   `GET /api/purchaseorders/{id}`: Get a specific purchase order by ID.
    *   `PUT /api/purchaseorders/{id}`: Update a specific purchase order by ID.
    *   `DELETE /api/purchaseorders/{id}`: Delete a specific purchase order by ID.
*   **Create Migrations:** Create and apply migrations to update the database schema with the new tables and relationships.

## 2. Frontend (simple-po-manager-ui):

*   **Create PurchaseOrderForm component:** This component will allow the user to create a new purchase order. It will include fields for:
    *   `CompanyId`: A dropdown list of companies.
    *   `OrderDate`: A date picker.
    *   `LineItems`: A list of line items, with fields for `ProductId`, `Quantity`, and `UnitPrice`.
*   **Create PurchaseOrderList component:** This component will display a list of purchase orders. It will include columns for:
    *   `Id`
    *   `CompanyId`
    *   `OrderDate`
    *   `TotalAmount`
*   **Update PurchaseOrders component:**
    *   Add a button to navigate to the PurchaseOrderForm.
    *   Display the PurchaseOrderList.
*   **Update App.js:** Add a route for the PurchaseOrders component.
*   **Update config.js:** Add the API endpoint for purchase orders.

## 3. Database:

*   The database will need to be updated to include the new tables for `PurchaseOrders` and `LineItems`.
